#Summary
This application was created in six hours as a fun refresher challenge.  I hadn't used Bootstrap in a while, as I am typically a bit of a CSS purist. I also wanted a quick SQL reminder.

This project combines my love of a challenge with my adoration for the show 30 Rock.

 3. npm start
 4. Navigate to localhost:4000
 

Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, AngularJS, node.js, Express, Postgresql
